        <h1>What is this?</h1>
        <p>This is my website. I post stuff I think is worth posting on the internet here. I'm a bit of an idealist: I still believe the internet is a grand exchange of ideas and information.
        </p>
        <p>To be more accurate, though, this is just one of my projects. I'm always trying to challenge myself
            and do something cool. Here, I post - and plant to post - personal projects, class reviews, math, 
            literature, and ideas... I don't know, just everything I think is worth sharing. I hope
            that maybe this will inspire someone else to do cool stuff too.
