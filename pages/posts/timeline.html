        <p data-timep="8">Arcangel is introduced as an old man waking up in Mazatlán. His introduction is the most mysterious of all the introductions in the book. It’s hard to tell if Arcangel is crazy or supernatural. Each time something is written to suggest Arcangel is something like an angel, there is something to suggest he’s just crazy and vice versa. For example Yamashita writes, “He said that he had come from a long way away, from the very tip of the Tierra del Fuego, from Isla Negra, from the very top of Machu Picchu, from the very bottom of the Foz do Iguaçu, but perhaps it was only a long way in his quixotic mind.” (Yamashita 66). Even if it somehow made sense that he could come from three very distinct places in South America, this claim of where he came would still be discredited in the same sentence. This ambiguous, nonchalant attitude sets the precedent for the way Arcangel’s supernatural powers will be treated by the narrator throughout the book.</p>
        <p data-timep="36">Upon encountering a stranded bus loaded with produce that’s about to go bad, Arcangel offers his services to pull the bus. Although he is ridiculed at first, he quickly gains support when people realize he wasn’t just a crazy old man. This is the first concrete example of Arcangel’s supernatural powers.</p>
        <p data-timep="63">Arcangel encounters the Cantina de Miseria y Hambre. As expected the environment is bleak at best. But Arcangel puts on a performance by becoming El Gran Mojado. Here, he announces his plan to fight SUPERNAFTA to the death. His performance invigorated the people at the cantina: he inspired them to follow him north.</p>
        <p data-timep="79">For some reason, Arcangel is helping Rodriguez build a wall. They talk about many things, but the conversation takes a sad turn when Rodriguez mentions his son. After Rodriguez mentions his son Arcangel begins to envision pain and death. Then, he lays some bricks to make space for Rodriguez’s corpse when he dies.</p>
        <p data-timep="102">After writing a rather sad poem for Sol, Arcangel does some crazy stuff. After Rafeala talks about how they haven’t been moving despite traveling for hours, the bus stops. Rafeala asks Arcangel to take care of Sol if anything were to happen to her and he agrees. As people get out to stretch their legs and go pee, Sol begins running towards the Jaguar that’s been tailing them for hours, also unmoving. The man driving wants to kidnap Sol, but Arcangel bends spacetime and really disorients the guy like straight out of a Doctor Strange movie. For some reason, Arcangel allows Rafeala to be captured, though which I don’t really understand.</p>
        <p data-timep="108">Arcangel gets out and begins to pull the bus after it breaks down. This is much harder for him than the bus full of produce, and he even sheds some blood. But still, he continues pulling everything, everyone from the south north to the border. He is questioned by the border agent once he reaches the border and here we learn some things about him. When he is about to run into trouble something odd happens. He starts to get pushed by everything he is pulling: all the people, money, and trade agreements of the south.</p>
        <p data-timep="130">Arcangel is being pushed by millions from the south. He reaches LA and asks someone how to get to East LA. However, the guy tells Arcangel to turn back, that he’s illegal and doesn’t belong. With every rebuttal, Arcangel has millions supporting him. After a while, Arcangel starts to perform and decides to hand out flyers for the fight between El Gran Mojado and SUPERNAFTA. The information is spread to millions in thousands of different languages. Then he decides to juggle an orange, and then gives it to Sol once a bunch of people start to focus on the Orange.</p>
        <p data-timep="156">Arcangel is killed by a f$%@ing patriotic rocket launcher.</p>
