        <p data-timep="8">Arcangel is introduced as an old man waking up in Mazatlán. His introduction is the most mysterious of all the introductions in the book. It’s hard to tell if Arcangel is crazy or supernatural. Each time something is written to suggest Arcangel is something like an angel, there is something to suggest he’s just crazy and vice versa. For example Yamashita writes, “He said that he had come from a long way away, from the very tip of the Tierra del Fuego, from Isla Negra, from the very top of Machu Picchu, from the very bottom of the Foz do Iguaçu, but perhaps it was only a long way in his quixotic mind.” (Yamashita 66). Even if it somehow made sense that he could come from three very distinct places in South America, this claim of where he came would still be discredited in the same sentence. This ambiguous, nonchalant attitude sets the precedent for the way Arcangel’s supernatural powers will be treated by the narrator throughout the book.</p>
        <p data-timep="36">Upon encountering a stranded bus loaded with produce that’s about to go bad, Arcangel offers his services to pull the bus. Although he is ridiculed at first, he quickly gains support when people realize he wasn’t just a crazy old man. This is the first concrete example of Arcangel’s supernatural powers.</p>
        <p data-timep="63">Arcangel encounters the Cantina de Miseria y Hambre. As expected the environment is bleak at best. But Arcangel puts on a performance by becoming El Gran Mojado. Here, he announces his plan to fight SUPERNAFTA to the death. His performance invigorated the people at the cantina: he inspired them to follow him north.</p>
