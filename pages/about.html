  <h1> What's Up! </h1>
  <p> There's so much information you can put on the internet. It's crazy. With that in mind, I put some information below instead of wasting a WIP page.</p>
  <p>According to road manager Don Opperman: "the way I remember it, the 'ooos' and the 'boos' were mixed together, but Stevie was pretty disappointed. Stevie [had] just handed me his guitar and walked off stage, and I'm like, 'are you coming back?' There was a doorway back there; the audience couldn't see the guys, but I could. He went back to the dressing room with his head in his hands. I went back there finally, and that was the end of the show."[66] According to Vaughan: "it wasn't the whole crowd [that booed]. It was just a few people sitting right up front. The room there was built for acoustic jazz. When five or six people boo, wow, it sounds like the whole world hates you. They thought we were too loud, but shoot, I had four army blankets folded over my amp, and the volume level was on 2. I'm used to playin' on 10!"[70] The performance was filmed and later released on DVD in September 2004.[71]

On the following night, Double Trouble was booked in the lounge of the Montreux Casino, with Jackson Browne in attendance. Browne jammed with Double Trouble until the early morning hours and offered them free use of his personal recording studio in downtown Los Angeles. In late November the band accepted his offer and recorded ten songs in two days.[72] While they were in the studio, Vaughan received a telephone call from David Bowie, who had met him after the Montreux performance, and he invited him to participate in a recording session for his next studio album, Let's Dance.[73] In January 1983, Vaughan recorded guitar on six of the album's eight songs, including the title track and "China Girl".[74] The album was released on April 14, 1983, and sold over three times as many copies as Bowie's previous album.[75]</p>
